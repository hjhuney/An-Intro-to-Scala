# Part 0: Intro to the Intro

This tutorial is designed to teach introductory Scala as a precursor to learning Apache Spark. 

Scala is an object-oriented and functional programming language. Itâ€™s is most closely related to Java, so Java programmers should have a leg up on learning it. However, Scala is designed to be more concise and have features of functional programming languages.

Spark is an open-source cluster-computing framework designed for big data processing. It is written in Scala. Spark can be run in Python ([PySpark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/api/python/pyspark.html)) and R ([SparkR and sparklyr](https://eddjberry.netlify.com/post/2017-12-05-sparkr-vs-sparklyr/)); however, the [best performance](https://www.dezyre.com/article/why-learn-scala-programming-for-apache-spark/198) with Spark can be achieved in Scala.


## Other Resources

I will offer some other sources as both alternatives and references. Jose Portilla's Udemy courses are great and my blog will series will loosely follow the structure for his ["Scala and Spark for Big Data and Machine Learning"](https://www.udemy.com/scala-and-spark-for-big-data-and-machine-learning/) course. If you learn better in video format, I highly recommend that course.

Marius Eriksen of Twitter has published ["Effective Scala"](http://twitter.github.io/effectivescala/), which is available online for free. That's a great resource, as well.

If you're coming from a Python background, you might also check out this [Python to Scala e-book](https://wrobstory.gitbooks.io/python-to-scala/content/index.html), written by [Rob Story](https://github.com/wrobstory). It's "short and sweet" and serves as a good quick reference for all you Pythoners and Pythonistas out there!
